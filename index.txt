We believe that writing correct distributed, concurrent, fault-tolerant and scalable applications is too hard.
Most of the time it's because we are using the wrong tools and the wrong level of abstraction.
Akka is here to change that. Using the Actor Model we raise the abstraction level and provide a better platform to build
scalable, resilient and responsive applicationsâ€”see the Reactive Manifesto for more details.
For fault-tolerance we adopt the let it crash model which the telecom industry has used with great success
to build applications that self-heal and systems that never stop.
Actors also provide the abstraction for transparent distribution and the basis for truly scalable and fault-tolerant applications.
